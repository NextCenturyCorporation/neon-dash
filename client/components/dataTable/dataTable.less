    // The CSS below is to make the text in the data table selectable (per
    // NEON-1863). It is taken from a comment in
    // https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/87 which is the bug filed
    // against ag-grid because text is not selectable. There are two downsides
    // of this fix:
    // 1. If text in multiple cells are selected, copied, and pasted, then there
    //    will be no space or comma between the data from the cells.
    // 2. If the user double-clicks to select a whole word, the edges of the
    //    cell are not treated as word boundaries. Double-clicking on the first
    //    or last word in a cell can cause the text in adjacent cell(s) to be
    //    selected as well.
    // One possible solution to these problems is to insert a zero-width div
    // that has a space in it between each cell.
