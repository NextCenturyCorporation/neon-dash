# Neon Dashboard

The Neon Dashboard is a big data exploration and visualization user interface.

## Prerequisites

* Install [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Install [Elasticsearch 6.4+](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
* Install [elasticdump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticdump) with `npm install -g elasticdump`
* Install [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) if not deploying with Docker
* Install the [Neon Server](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/neon-server)
* (Optional) Install the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) with `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Step-by-Step Production Installation Documentation

See the page [here](./STEP_BY_STEP_INSTALLATION.md).  Requires a sample data bundle provided by the development team.

## Configure the Neon Dashboard

Create a Neon Dashboard config file at `src/app/config/config.json` or `src/app/config/config.yaml`.  See the [Neon Dashboard Configuration Guide](./DASHBOARD_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md) for more information.

## Build and Run the Neon Dashboard Locally

To build the Neon Dashboard: `npm install`

Copy the [sample proxy config file](./sample.proxy.conf.json) to `./proxy.conf.json` and change the port if your Neon Server will not run on port 8080 (the default).

To start the Neon Dashboard, first start the Neon Server, then run: `npm start`

This will start the Neon Dashboard on http://localhost:4200 and should auto-reload the page whenever you modify a file.

To see anything useful, you will need to ingest data into your datastore(s).

## Unit Test and Lint

To start the unit tests and linters, run: `npm test`

## Unit Test

To start just the unit tests, run: `npm run-script unit-test`

The unit tests are run using a [Karma config file](./karma.conf.js).  The unit tests are written with [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

## Lint

To start just the linters, run: `npm run-script lint`

The linters use the following libraries:
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [TypeScript ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint)
- [JS Beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify) (HTML only)
- [Sass Lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) and [Sass Lint Auto Fix](https://github.com/srowhani/sass-lint-auto-fix)

The linters are run using the following files:
- [.eslintrc.yml](./.eslintrc.yml)
- [.jsbeautifyrc](./.jsbeautifyrc)
- [sass-lint.yaml](./sass-lint.yaml) and [sass-lint-auto-fix.yaml](./sass-lint-auto-fix.yaml)

## Deploy as WAR

To build the Neon Dashboard as a WAR (replacing "whatever" with your custom WAR name):

        npm run-script build whatever

Your WAR name should also be your Apache Tomcat deployment URL.  For example, the command above would generate `target/whatever.war` for you to copy into your Apache Tomcat `webapps` directory and access the Neon Dashboard at `http://hostname:port/whatever`.

Note:  This command will build the dashboard for a production environment (`--prod`) and using the ahead-of-time compiler option (`--aot`) to improve runtime performance.

## Deploy as Docker Image

To build the Neon Dashboard and run it as a Docker Image:

        npm run-script build
        docker-compose up

Now you can view the Neon Dashboard at http://localhost:4100
