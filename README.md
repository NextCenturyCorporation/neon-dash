# Neon Dashboard
The Neon Dashboard (neon-dash) is a sample analysis dashboard built upon the [Neon Framework][5]. It includes a number of geo-spatial and temporal data visualizations built as [Angular][13] components that use the Neon framework to query and filter data served by [MongoDB][8], [Elasticsearch 1.7][14] or an [Apache Spark][9] server. 

[Neon][5] is a software platform designed to help developers integrate disparate visualization widgets with your data stores. It includes a **Data Access API** that makes it easy to query an underlying database directly from JavaScript or RESTful endpoints. Additionally, the [Neon][5] **Interaction API** provides capabilities for inter-widget communication and shared data filters, allowing multiple visualizations to interact without being explicityly aware of one another.

This project was generated with [angular-cli][ng-cli].

## Prerequisites
Building the **neon-dash** application requires [Node.js][Node.js] (Version 6.9.x or higher).  Once node has been installed, you should install the [Angular Command Line Interface][ng-cli] with the following command: 

		npm install -g @angular/cli

Now, install the dependencies:

		npm install

## Run Development Server

Start a [Neon server][neon] running on port 8080. As an alternate to building the server, you can use the [Neon Quickstart Docker Image][neon-quickstart].

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build for Deployment

If you need to deliver the application to someone else, so need the war file, run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Generating Documentation

Run `npm run docs` to generate the documentation into the `docs/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Code scaffolding

If you wish to create a new component, run `ng generate component <component-name>` to generate the appropriate files as a basis. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/route/class`.

## Pre-Commit Hooks

This project is set up to run `ng lint` before all commits. This will add a delay before you are able to make a commit.
The hook can be skipped by using `git commit -n` - Only use this if the changes are only to non-Typescript files.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Build and run the example

**Note**: These examples are for deploying the webapp to `/neon-dash/` in a web container.
Change all instances of `neon-dash` in the instructions if you want to use a different relative URL.

Running the application requires a functioning Neon deployment.  Links to the Neon deployment instructions and the command line instructions to build **neon-dash** follow:

1. [Build and Deploy a Neon server][2], drop the [latest neon.war][neon-war] in a web application container such as [Tomcat][tomcat], or use the [Neon Quickstart Docker Image][neon-quickstart].

2. Clone the neon-dash repo

        git clone https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/neon-dash.git
        cd neon-dash/
        
3. Copy the sample NEON-DASH configuration file to the app config folder or supply your own.  The configuration file specifies the default datasets and visualizations to display.  It is described in detail [here][15].  The sample configuration file is setup for the sample earthquake data referenced in step 1.

        # Copy either the YAML or JSON config file.  If Neon-Dash cannot find one, 
        # it will look for the other.  
        cp app/config/sample.config.yaml app/config/config.yaml
        cp app/config/sample.config.json app/config/config.json

4. Use npm to download dependencies, then build the application:

        npm install
        ng build --base-href /neon-dash/

5. Deploy the built webapp to your container from step 1.

*For Tomcat*: Create a `neon-dash` directory under the <apache-tomcat>/webapps folder. Copy all the built files under `dist/` to this directory.

*For Others*: The built app requires that the Neon server is accessible as the `/neon` URL on the host. For other deployments, you can deploy the Neon-Dash project on a standard web server such as nginx or Apache, and proxy `/neon` to your Neon server.

6. If running against a stock, localhost Tomcat instance, browse to the [http://localhost:8080/neon-dash/][neon-dash-localhost] to verify its installation.  The [Users Guide][neon-dash-guide] describes its basic use.
